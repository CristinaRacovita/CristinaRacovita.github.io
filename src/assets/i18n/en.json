    "transport-use-case": "shipping volume prediction",
    "transport-problem": "Delivery companies struggle to optimize their fleet size for particular tasks such as transporting returned products.",
    "transport-solution-data": "To solve this problem, Odin will learn from a data set of historical product returns of real customers. This tabular data set has only 137 examples and consists of information such as order date, buyer name and address, order quantity and price, shipping fee, payment method, and whether the product was returned.",
    "transport-benefits": "After learning these details, Odin can predict the order status for existing or new customers in the following period with an accuracy of 94.90%. Therefore the fleet size used to transport returned products could be estimated in advance to minimize the cost.",
    "manufacturing-description": "Has obstacles such as product quality issues, downtimes for production lines, and inefficient energy consumption. These problems can be easily solved by leveraging artificial intelligence techniques.",
    "manufacturing-use-case": "predictive maintenance",
    "manufacturing-problem": "Factories face spontaneous production shutdowns or quality issues due to damaged equipment not being repaired in time.",
    "manufacturing-solution-data": "To solve this issue, Odin can predict if the equipment will break soon or if it will defect in some special conditions. In this case, it is done by learning from a tabular data set with 7998 examples of historical sensor data and the corresponding behavior of the equipment. The recorded data includes the crafted product quality, temperature, rotations per minute, torque, tool wear, and whether the equipment has failed.",
    "manufacturing-benefits": "The generated solution can detect with an accuracy of 98.68% if the equipment will break soon without the need for a specialist that checks it periodically. In this way, the quality of crafted products and the desired production capacity will always be achieved.",
    "finance-description": "Deals with security breaches, fraudulent transactions, human errors, customer retention difficulties, and clients who no longer can pay their debts. These complications cannot always be solved conventionally, so artificial intelligence is needed.",
    "finance-use-case": "loan default prediction",
    "finance-problem": "When granting a loan, the bank cannot know for sure if the borrower will not be able to pay his debts in the future.",
    "finance-solution-data": "To resolve this predictive problem, Odin can learn from a data set of loans granted by the bank. In this example, the tabular data set has 25999 examples of loans that were defaulted or not. The data details the client concerning age, income, homeownership, years of work experience, if the customer defaulted on a loan before, and how many years he had loans. Also, there are included details about the current loan and if the borrower has defaulted it.",
    "finance-benefits": "After the learning phase, Odin can detect with an accuracy of 93.66% if a borrower will default on his loan just by using the type of information employed for training. In this way, any bank can pick their clients more confidently without risking granting money to someone who will not be able to pay them back.",
    "marketing-description": "Runs into problems such as targeting the right audience, choosing the best channels, and estimating the conversion rate and return on investment for campaigns before launching them.",
    "marketing-use-case": "targeted advertisement",
    "marketing-problem": "Marketers cannot know for sure, without running actual tests, which is the best type of advertisement, where to place it, and what is the most valuable kind of audience.",
    "marketing-solution-data": "To find out if an advertisement will be clicked by a person, Odin will initially learn from a data set of historical records that consists of 798 ad placement scenarios. The data includes details about the user as daily site and internet usage, age and gender, and demographic features such as area income, city, and country. Also, information like date, time, ad topic, and if the user clicked it are characteristics registered in the data.",
    "marketing-benefits": "After assimilating all the necessary details Odin can predict with an accuracy of 97.52% if a targeted person will click a particular ad. Thus Odin can understand the behavior of real users and predict the actions of new ones, leading to better ad placement without actually testing campaigns."
